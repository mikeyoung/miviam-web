#### Description:
MiViAm 2.0 is a web app version of the classic, no longer available iOS app "MiViAm".

The web app version runs in all major browsers and is very light on network and local resources.

MiViAm uses sound samples from a Mellotron and a Fender Rhodes electric piano to produce an endless sequence of relaxing notes which play over a bed of ambient vinyl LP surface sound. Since MiViAm produces unique sequences which will not repeat there is no pattern to focus on and tire of. The frequency of the chimes can be set and each instrument can be turned on or off.
